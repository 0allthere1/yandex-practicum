# Integrated Project 1
You work for the online store Ice, which sells videogames all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This allows you to put your money on a potentially hot new item and plan advertising campaigns. In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017. The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2027 sales based on data from 2026. The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board). The ESRB evaluates a game's content and assigns an appropriate age categories, such as Teen and Mature.
