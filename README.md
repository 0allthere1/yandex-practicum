# Integrated project 2
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. You need to:
    
    - Prepare the data;
    - Perform data analysis;
    - Develop and train a model. To complete the project, you may want to use documentation from pandas, 
      matplotlib, and sklearn. The next lesson is about the ore purification process. You will pick 
      the information that is important for the model development.
