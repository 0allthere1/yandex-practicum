Project 5:
You have two CSVs:
/datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv. It contains the following data:
company_name: taxi company name
trips_amount: the number of rides for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017.
/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv. It contains the following data:
dropoff_location_name: Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended
average_trips: the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017.
For these two datasets you now need to

    import the files
    study the data they contain
    make sure the data types are correct
    identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs
    make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs
    draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results

Testing hypotheses (Python)
/datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv — the result of the last query. It contains data on rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport. Remember, these are the table's field values:

    start_ts:
        pickup date and time
    weather_conditions:
        weather conditions at the moment the ride started
    duration_seconds:
        ride duration in seconds

Test the hypothesis:
"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."
Decide where to set the significance level (alpha) on your own.
Explain:

    how you formed the null and alternative hypotheses
    what criterion you used to test the hypotheses and why

How will my project be evaluated?
Here are the project assessment criteria. Read them over carefully before you get to work.
Here’s what the project reviewer will look for when assessing your project:

    how you retrieve data from the website
    how you make data slices
    how you group data
    whether you use the various methods for combining data correctly
    how you formulate hypotheses
    what criteria you use to test the hypotheses and why
    what conclusions you reach
    whether you leave comments at each step
